# Architectural Projects - Fixed Version

## âœ… **Issues Fixed:**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Progress Dots Only in Architecture Section**

- Changed from `fixed` to `absolute` positioning
- Dots now only appear within the architectural projects section
- No longer visible on other parts of the website

### ðŸ”„ **All Projects Now Visible**

- Improved scroll calculation logic
- Each card gets equal scroll space across all projects
- Better distribution: 12 total cards (3 projects Ã— 4 cards each)

### âš¡ **Better Stack Movement**

- Increased section height to `600vh` for more scroll space
- Added debug indicator showing current project/card
- Enhanced scroll detection and progress calculation
- Smoother transitions between cards and projects

## ðŸŽ® **How It Works Now:**

### **Scroll Distribution:**

- **Total scroll space:** 600vh (6 times viewport height)
- **12 cards total:** Each card gets 50vh of scroll space
- **Project 1:** Cards 1-4 (0-200vh)
- **Project 2:** Cards 5-8 (200vh-400vh)
- **Project 3:** Cards 9-12 (400vh-600vh)

### **Visual Indicators:**

- **Debug text:** Shows "Project X/3 - Card Y/4"
- **Project dots:** 3 larger dots showing current project
- **Card dots:** 4 smaller dots showing cards within current project
- **Smooth animations:** 700ms transitions between cards

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements:**

### **Scroll Logic:**

```javascript
// Better calculation distributing scroll across all cards
const totalCards = 12; // 3 projects Ã— 4 cards
const progressPerCard = 1 / totalCards;
const currentCardGlobal = Math.floor(progress / progressPerCard);
```

### **Positioning Fix:**

```css
/* Progress indicators now relative to section */
position: absolute; /* was: fixed */
bottom: 8;
```

### **Animation Enhancement:**

```jsx
// Force re-render for smooth transitions
key={`${currentProject}-${currentCard}`}
```

## ðŸš€ **Test Instructions:**

1. **Navigate to Architecture section**
2. **Scroll down slowly** - you should see:
   - Debug text changing: "Project 1/3 - Card 1/4" â†’ "Project 1/3 - Card 2/4" etc.
   - Content changing for each card
   - Project dots highlighting current project
   - Card dots filling up as you progress
3. **Continue scrolling** through all 3 projects
4. **Progress dots disappear** when you scroll past the section

The deck-of-cards effect now works properly with smooth transitions between all projects and cards!
